# Customer-Support-Chatbot-Using-Zephyr-7B-beta
As part of our master’s program in "Marketing, Revenue Management, and Data Science," we embarked on 
a project to develop an intelligent customer support chatbot. This initiative leverages the Zephyr-7B-beta 
large language model (LLM), which we fine-tuned using Google Colab’s Paid tier A100-SXM4-40G . 
The model training process was based on advanced techniques such as QLoRa (Quantized Low-Rank 
Adaptation) and PERF, enabling efficient optimization and deployment on limited computational resources.
 The objective of this project is to create a chatbot capable of autonomously addressing frequent customer 
inquiries and providing effective support. By employing a quantized LLM, we ensured the model remains 
lightweight and fast while delivering high-quality, context-aware responses. This approach not only 
optimizes customer service operations and reduces response times but also demonstrates the feasibility of 
leveraging state-of-the-art AI models in resource-constrained environments.
 This report outlines the implementation process in two phases:
 1. General Overview – Introducing the project scope, objectives, and the technical foundation, 
including the Zephyr-7B-beta model, QLoRa, and PERF concepts. This section also explores how 
chatbots function, their architecture, and the various types and approaches for implementing chatbot 
systems. Additionally, it provides an overview of different tools available for building chatbots.
 2. Application Development – Detailing the steps involved in designing, training, and deploying the 
chatbot, as well as testing its performance to meet functional requirements
